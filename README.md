# File Storage System Development Based on Unity3d
## Abstract
This project is mainly released based on WebGL technology and aims to provide users with a feature-rich platform. Users can securely store files in the cloud by registering a personal account. The project involves the integration of SMS services and object storage services, allowing users to easily upload local files to the cloud and download cloud files to local devices at any time. Such comprehensive functions provide users with a convenient file management and sharing experience. Whether in the process of uploading or downloading files, the security, safety and reliability of the data can be guaranteed.

### I.	Login interface
The login interface is one of the entrances to the project, which provides the function for users to log in to the system. Users can log in using their registered personal account and password to easily access various functions and services of the project. Ensure only authorized users can access their personal files and information by providing a secure authentication login interface. Users can enter credentials and perform identity verification on the login interface to easily enter the main related file storage service platform.

### II.	Registration interface
The registration interface is the entrance to join the user project. Here, new users can fill in the necessary information, such as username, password and other personal information, to create a personal account. Registration interfaces often include verification mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and authority of the information provided. After the user successfully registers, he can log in to the system and start using the file storage service platform. The registration interface is an important part of the user experience. It provides the first step for users to interact with the project.

### III.	File storage service platform
The file storage service platform is one of the core features of the project, providing users with the ability to securely store files in the cloud. Users can upload local files to the cloud through the platform and download files to the cloud to local devices when needed. The platform usually provides a browsing user interface that allows users to easily manage and organize their files. At the same time, it also ensures the security and privacy protection of user files. The file storage service platform provides users with a convenient way to store, share and access files, which is very useful for both personal use and team collaboration.

## Notice
The project is mainly released on WebGL, which is a technology used to transmit 3D graphics on web pages. Users can store files in the cloud by registering a personal account. To achieve this feature, you need to use a cloud storage service, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. These services allow you to securely store and manage user-uploaded files.

In addition, the project you mentioned earlier also allows SMS services to be involved. In order to achieve this function, you can use the API of SMS service giants, such as Twilio, Nexmo or Alibaba Cloud SMS Service. With these APIs, you can send SMS verification codes or other notifications to users through Smashing.

To summarize, your project will require the following main components:

WebGL Application: Technology used to render 3D graphics on web pages.

① User registration and authentication: Users can register for a personal account and use that account to log in to your WebGL application.

② Cloud storage service: used to upload user files to cloud storage and manage these files securely. You can choose to use cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, etc.

③ File upload and download: Users can upload local files to the cloud and download files from the cloud to local devices.

④ SMS service: You can use the API of SMS service giants such as Twilio, Nexmo or Alibaba Cloud SMS Service to send SMS verification codes or other notifications to users.

⑤ By integrating these components together, you can create a WebGL application with user registration, file storage and management, file upload and download, and SMS service functions.
